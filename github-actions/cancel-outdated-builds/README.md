# cancel-outdated-builds

The `cancel-outdated-builds` action cancels the current build if a new commit is
pushed on the branch that started the build. There is no stability guarantee
for this action, since it's supposed to only be used in infra managed by us.

## Usage

To use the action add this to your workflow:

```yaml
- uses: rust-lang/simpleinfra/github-actions/cancel-outdated-builds@master
  with:
    github_token: "${{ secrets.github_token }}"
```

By default the action will check the GitHub API every minute. To use a custom
check interval you can add the `check_every_seconds` input with the amount of
seconds to wait between checks:

```yaml
- uses: rust-lang/simpleinfra/github-actions/cancel-outdated-builds@master
  with:
    github_token: "${{ secrets.github_token }}"
    check_every_seconds: 120 # 2 minutes
```

## Development

The action is written in NodeJS 16, and you can install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

GitHub Actions requires all the dependencies to be committed, so before
creating a commit you need to run:

```
npm run build
```

The command will bundle everything in `dist/index.js`. That file will need to
be committed.
